# JSONL-File-Generator
This is a simple web application that allows users to create JSONL files for fine-tuning OpenAI's GPT models. The application includes fields for entering "System", "User", and "Assistant" messages, stores data in the browser's local storage to prevent data loss on refresh, and supports multiple languages (English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Hindi).
